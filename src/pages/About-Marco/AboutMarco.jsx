                <p>Marco Eiffel emerges as a compelling figure in European politics, driven by a fervent dedication to 
                    upholding the fundamental values of sovereignty, security, and prosperity.</p>
                <p>Born and raised in Zwickau in 1980, Marco Eiffel developed a deep-rooted appreciation for his nation from an early age. 
                    He exceled at mathematics and went on to study Economics at TU Dresden after completing his Abitur, graduating with honors in 2003.
                    Wanting to prove himsef again and to strengthen his discipline and leadership skills he decided to serve in the Bundeswahr. 
                    As a member of the military, Marco was stationed in Kaiserslautern and reached the rank of Oberstabsgefreiter.</p>
                <p>After serving with distinction in the army, in 2007 Marco transitioned to the real estate sector, where he leveraged his expertise to deliver neoclassical projects and foster economic growth 
                    and development in Sachsen. Through his work in real estate, Marco gained firsthand insight into the challenges and opportunities facing Eastern German 
                    businesses and individuals. He maintains a successful agency which has expanded across East Germany.</p>
                <p>Eiffel joined the AfD in 2016 due to disillusion with old parties especially in the aftermath of a new migration wave. He wants to represent Germans who feel alienated by
                    the constant changes and promote cooperation with like-minded Europeans. Coming from a humble middle-class background he is your man to vote!</p>
